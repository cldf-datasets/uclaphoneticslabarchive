Hearing what older brother said when we asked him, we went and returned to where its (the tapir's) tracks were and together we trailed him into there.  We said, ""Here was where he came back,"" and we, Aquileo and I, trailed him.  We trailed him to the old one's place, and on past that, and arrived at where it had slept.  We passed by there, and there it lay looking at us.  When it lay there looking at us and our two shotguns, we shot straight at him.  When we shot him, he jumped up and ran.  When he jumped up and ran, we chased him but didn't catch him.  When he went along the other side of the hill, going a long way beside Tucunaré creek, we trailed him along beside it.  Seeing that he descended along beside it, we did, too, and turned and went straight down.  When we went down a long way, that old Cubeo man, the old thing, shot him.  When he saw that he had shot it, he chased it and shot it again, and we heard it and went down there.  When the tapir went back up again, we chased him back up.  We chased him uphill, to the savana, and back down.  Seeing that Aquileo was chasing him there, I went to head him off, to shoot him when he came swimming down the river.  Seeing him when he first came swimming down the river, when he went under the water, when he came back up to the top of the water, Aquileo shot straight at him.  When he turned and floated, we chased him and shot him again.  When we chased him and shot him again, he went up out of the river and he fell and lay there.  Then he got up, slipped, and came back.  So seeing that he fell and lay there, we cut it up.  Cutting it up, we carried two legs.  We returned.  When we set the pieces down in the center of the savana, we arrived down at Tucunaré creek.  Crossing over and coming up, we shot to Dad to call him and listened.  Calling and listening, we shot.

Hearing what older brother said when we asked him, we went and returned to where its (the tapir's) tracks were and together we trailed him into there.  We said, \""Here was where he came back,\"" and we, Aquileo and I, trailed him.  We trailed him to the old one's place, and on past that, and arrived at where it had slept.  We passed by there, and there it lay looking at us.  When it lay there looking at us and our two shotguns, we shot straight at him.  When we shot him, he jumped up and ran.  When he jumped up and ran, we chased him but didn't catch him.  When he went along the other side of the hill, going a long way beside Tucunare\u0301 creek, we trailed him along beside it.  Seeing that he descended along beside it, we did, too, and turned and went straight down.  When we went down a long way, that old Cubeo man, the old thing, shot him.  When he saw that he had shot it, he chased it and shot it again, and we heard it and went down there.  When the tapir went back up again, we chased him back up.  We chased him uphill, to the savana, and back down.  Seeing that Aquileo was chasing him there, I went to head him off, to shoot him when he came swimming down the river.  Seeing him when he first came swimming down the river, when he went under the water, when he came back up to the top of the water, Aquileo shot straight at him.  When he turned and floated, we chased him and shot him again.  When we chased him and shot him again, he went up out of the river and he fell and lay there.  Then he got up, slipped, and came back.  So seeing that he fell and lay there, we cut it up.  Cutting it up, we carried two legs.  We returned.  When we set the pieces down in the center of the savana, we arrived down at Tucunare\u0301 creek.  Crossing over and coming up, we shot to Dad to call him and listened.  Calling and listening, we shot.  Calling to Dad and listening, Dad finally arrived up there.""}"

When the two were leaving Taketshwane they saw ǂa̰asa and he told them of a young springbok which was at the water hole, whose hoof was hurt and who was not able to run.  They agreed to go to it wanting to kill it and sell its skin to the whiteman's store at Kang.  But then ǃaǀi refused and said he was extremely hungry and wanted to hunt the wildebeest and eat their meat.  If he could do that he would return to the young springbok and kill it.  Boroǁxao agreed but ǂa̰asa refused and said that he was the oldest person amongst themselves and he knew a lot.  Were they to kill the springbok they would get a lot of money and they could go and buy things from the whiteman in Kang; they could buy food and eat and not be hungry.  Boroǁxao asked ǂa̰asa whether he no longer approved of hunting when he felt hungry and whether he was now a whiteman or Bantu buying food and not hunting for it.  ǂa̰asa became angry with them and told them to go and hunt.

The story is as follows.  At that time Koxinga Cheng Ch'eng Kung had just landed at Tainan and had just led his troops from the south to the north, to this place Iron Anvil Mountain.  Now since, one day, when the troops were staying there, there was no water for any of the troops to drink, Koxinga Cheng Ch'eng Kung sent men everywhere to look and see if there was any water.  And he himself went nearby to seek if there was any spring or stream with water to drink.  He went to Iron Anvil Mountain to look there and as he was walking back and forth, he came to a certain place.  Now he pulled out his sword, and as he was digging in the earth, suddenly his sword sank into the ground and from the ground a spring flowed out.  Afterwards this place became a well.
