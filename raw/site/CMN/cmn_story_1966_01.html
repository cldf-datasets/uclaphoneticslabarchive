<td>At Tachia there is a place called Iron Anvil Mountain.  There is a story about this Iron Anvil Mountain.  There is a Sword Well at Iron Anvil Mountain.  Afterwards a temple was built beside Sword Well, and it is called Koxinga Temple, because it is said that the story comes down from the time Koxinga Cheng Ch'eng Kung arrived at this place.  The story is as follows.  At that time Koxinga Cheng Ch'eng Kung had just landed at Tainan and had just led his troops from the south to the north, to this place Iron Anvil Mountain.  Now since, one day, when the troops were staying there, there was no water for any of the troops to drink, Koxinga Cheng Ch'eng Kung sent men everywhere to look and see if there was any water.  And he himself went nearby to seek if there was any spring or stream with water to drink.  He went to Iron Anvil Mountain to look there and as he was walking back and forth, he came to a certain place.  Now he pulled out his sword, and as he was digging in the earth, suddenly his sword sank into the ground and from the ground a spring flowed out.  Afterwards this place became a well.  So people called the well "Sword Well".  This is the origin of this name "Sword Well". </td>
