<td>Long ago ǃaǀi and Boroǁxao went hunting after wildebeest at Kang, whose tracks they had seen in the road.  When the two were leaving Taketshwane they saw ǂa̰asa and he told them of a young springbok which was at the water hole, whose hoof was hurt and who was not able to run.  They agreed to go to it wanting to kill it and sell its skin to the whiteman's store at Kang.  But then ǃaǀi refused and said he was extremely hungry and wanted to hunt the wildebeest and eat their meat.  If he could do that he would return to the young springbok and kill it.  Boroǁxao agreed but ǂa̰asa refused and said that he was the oldest person amongst themselves and he knew a lot.  Were they to kill the springbok they would get a lot of money and they could go and buy things from the whiteman in Kang; they could buy food and eat and not be hungry.  Boroǁxao asked ǂa̰asa whether he no longer approved of hunting when he felt hungry and whether he was now a whiteman or Bantu buying food and not hunting for it.  ǂa̰asa became angry with them and told them to go and hunt.  He was the one who would see money, not them, idiots that they were; so he went off to the water hole where the young springbok was. &nbsp;</td>

<td>They went to the wildebeest and picked up their tracks at the Bantu village and when they saw them, shot a large bull.  Then they slept for a time and got up in the late afternoon and took the wildebeest's spoor and followed it.  When they got to it they killed it with a spear and skinned it and placed the meat in a tree and then ate and slept.  They awoke next day and went home with the meat.  On the way they saw ǂa̰asa but he was without the springbok's skin.  So they asked him what he had done when he left them.  ǂa̰asa fell silent and just looked at the ground refusing to answer them.  When he spoke he said he was very hungry and hadn't had food for two days.  They laughed at him and asked him about stupidity and money.  ǂa̰asa remained silent and just ate the meat they gave him.&nbsp;</td>
